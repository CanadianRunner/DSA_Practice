## Technologies Used

* Python
* LeetCode Platform
* University of Helsinki MOOC


## Description

This repository showcases my ongoing journey mastering Data Structures and Algorithms through structured coursework and practical problem-solving. I'm actively building foundational CS knowledge that complements my professional full-stack development experience, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and technical growth.

**What's Inside:**

* **University of Helsinki Python 2025 MOOC**: Completed exercises and projects, covering fundamental programming concepts, data structures, and algorithmic thinking
* **LeetCode Solutions**: My approaches to algorithm and data structure problems, with clear documentation of problem-solving strategies and time/space complexity analysis
* **Clean, Documented Code**: Each solution includes comments explaining the approach, edge cases considered, and lessons learned

**Why This Matters:**

While my professional work has been focused on full-stack application development with C#, .NET, React, and SQL, I recognize that strong DSA fundamentals are essential for writing efficient, scalable code. This repository represents my proactive effort to strengthen my computer science foundations and prepare for technical interviews at top-tier companies.

I approach DSA practice the same way I approach software development: with attention to detail, a focus on maintainability, and a commitment to understanding not just *how* something works, but *why* it works.
