# DSA Practice Problems

#### By **Sean Keane**

#### November 2024 - Present

## Technologies Used

* Python
* LeetCode Platform
* University of Helsinki MOOC

## Description

This repository showcases my ongoing journey mastering Data Structures and Algorithms through structured coursework and practical problem-solving. I'm actively building foundational CS knowledge that complements my professional full-stack development experience, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and technical growth. This work also serves as an opportunity to gain competence in Python, expanding my technical toolkit beyond my primary professional experience with C#, .NET, JavaScript, React, and TypeScript.

**What's Inside:**

* **University of Helsinki Python 2025 MOOC**: Completed exercises and projects, covering fundamental programming concepts, data structures, and algorithmic thinking. All solutions have passed all test cases and edge cases on the platform.
* **LeetCode Solutions**: My approaches to algorithm and data structure problems with focus on solving real technical interview challenges. All solutions have passed all test cases and edge cases on the platform.
* **Progressive Documentation**: I incorporate detailed comments explaining problem-solving approaches, algorithmic strategies, and time/space complexity analysis

**Why This Matters:**

While my professional work has been focused on full-stack application development with C#, .NET, React, and SQL, I recognize that strong DSA fundamentals are essential for writing efficient, scalable code. This repository represents my proactive effort to strengthen my computer science foundations, gain proficiency in Python, and prepare for technical interviews at top-tier companies.

I approach DSA practice the same way I approach software development: with attention to detail, a focus on maintainability, and a commitment to understanding not just *how* something works, but *why* it works.
